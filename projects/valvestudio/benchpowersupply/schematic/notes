Craig -- if you put 15k||100nF on the source of Q1 and up-bias the MOSFET it linearizes quite nicely.
gatestopper on Q2 should be 100R
circuit needs compensation to avoid smoke.
if you are going to ramp you need C1 (in your design) just adequate for stability.
the attached is the circuit I used, pretty much, for an article in AudioXpress around 2005
