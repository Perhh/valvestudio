read "Renewal of Copyright" https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ15.pdf, "If a copyright originally secured before January 1, 1964, was not renewed at the proper time, copyright protection expired at the end of the 28th calendar year of the copyright and could not be restored."
did a copyright search, renewals of the 1940 document "Calculation and design of resistance-coupled amplifiers using pentode tubes" would have happened in 1968 and 1996 (28 year period), nothing turned up for 1996 using this copyright search
